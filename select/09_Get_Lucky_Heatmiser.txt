Let me put you in the play
Down all the days
Cast for your time
A sucker in the line
To be told you're so fine
You deserve the hire
Well, some folks cannot be satisfied
And they just want somebody to ride
(Well, here it comes) And you're the one they want
To have and have
And never have not
(Oh!) So take what you expect
And put it in reverse
See which one of us
Bangs the cymbals first
We're taking you to pieces
We're taking you to pieces
We're taking you to pieces
We're taking you to pieces
You make it really easy
You make it really easy
(Oh!) You're never going to touch me with your curse
Get inside their minds, before they get to yours
(Repeat chorus 2x)
Get lucky!
